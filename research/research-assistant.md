<h3> A DSGE with Financial Heterogeneous Intermediaries - Nuno Coimbra & Hélène Rey</h3>

<p> In <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w23245" target = "blank">Coimbra and Rey (2017)</a>, the authors develop a macroeconomic model in which financial intermediaries are heterogenous with respect to how much they can leverage. They then use this model to study how monetary policy affects the financial stability. In this new paper, Nuno Coimbra and Hélène Rey wants to integrate their heterogeneous intermediaries framework into a standard DSGE à la <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w6455" target = "blank">Bernanke, Gertler, and Gilchrist (1999)</a>. My role is to construct a DSGE that fits well with their framework, numerically solve the model, and perform its quantitative evaluation. </p>

<h3> Location and Household Size - Nicolas Coeurdacier, Pierre-Philippe Combes & Florian Oswald</h3>

<p> In urban models, households decide where to locate in the city, but the size of the population is eventually exogenous. In this model, Coeurdacier, Combes and Oswald introduce a fertility decision in the household problem, to see how this affects the distribution of agents within and across cities. My job is twofold: build the numerical methods to solve the model, and help developing an extension of the model where households are heterogenous in some dimensions (preferences, skills...). </p>

<h2> Past projects </h2>

<h3> Replication and Estimation of Dosi et al. (2013) - Matteo Richiardi </h3>

<p> <a href = "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016518891000148X" target = "blank">Dosi et al. (2010, 2013, 2015) </a> have become standard workhorses in the macroeconomic agent-based literature. Yet, very little work have been devoted to reproducing their results, which depends heavily on the calibration they use. Using the <a href = "http://www.jas-mine.net/" target = "blank" >platform developed by Matteo Richiardi</a>, the goal was to replicate their 2013 model to then estimate its structural parameters using Bayesian methods.  </p>

<h3> Potential Output and the European Union - Francesco Saraceno </h3>

<p> Over the last twenty years, cyclically adjusted budgets have become a central element of
the European treaties. Yet, these rely heavily on potential output, whose estimation can be complicated. My job was threefold: summarize the use of potential output in modern macroeconomics and in the European treaties, and review the different estimation techniques currently used by international institutions. </p>
