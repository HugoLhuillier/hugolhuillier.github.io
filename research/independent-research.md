<h3> Intergenerational Transfer without Commitment: a Macroeconomic Framework </h3>

[<a href="/ext-files/pdfs/intergenationalTransferLhuillier2017.pdf" target = "blank">very preliminary version</a>]

**Abstract**: Can a heterogeneous agent model replicate the empirical wealth distribution when individuals are altruistic and strategic? To answer this question, this paper constructs a heterogeneous agent model with a life cycle and overlapping generations. The main unit of interest is the family, constituted of two generations with their own preferences. The older generation values the utility of its descendant. The decision-making process is thought as a two-stage non-cooperative game, and both players do not have access to commitment devices. In this model, intergenerational transfers occur and are driven by two main motives. First, transfers are used by parents to redistribute wealth across the members of the family. Second, they are used as a risk sharing tool to help the young member of the family smooth its consumption when faced by adverse shocks. Both motives eventually push savings upwards. We test the predictions of the model, and find that its qualitative properties are in line with the empirical evidence on life cycle consumption, savings and intergenerational transfer. The model is also able to generate a wealth distribution with a relatively thick right tail.

<h3> Endogenous and Heterogeneous Risk Aversion </h3>

**Idea**: A cornerstone assumption in economics is that preferences are fixed, or at least
exogenous. Yet, labor disutility, taste for certain products, or risk aversion, are all depending on the context in which the choices I made. We apply this idea in an heterogeneous agent macroeconomic model. In it, individuals are maximizing their utility, taking into account that their future risk aversion is a function of their present decisions. This model produces *ex post* heterogeneous expectations, and a distribution of risk aversion that evolves with aggregate shocks. This is a desirable feature to match several empirical evidence.

<h3> Time Consistent Public Policies with Heterogeneous Households </h3>
<h4> with Théo Durandard </h4>

**Idea**: Since the work of <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2354.t01-1-00107/abstract" target = "blank"> Klein and Rìos-Rull (2003)</a>, considerable progresses have been achieved in studying time-consistent / Markov perfect public policies. Yet, one of the key assumptions is that there exists a representative household which takes future policies as given. This assumption can be rationalized if households are heterogeneous. Some preliminary work on time-consistent policies with heterogeneous agents has been conducted in <a href="https://b06b5b97-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/galonunobarrau/OSPMFG.pdf?attachauth=ANoY7cqMZKGXNdm0CidG0Uxa5oT5tjKkkivHqBKkW2KpL5rs6JrasILBnYXP5ZYhZGSIFg3zQuWaraMgIRe85A-FumhcXJgPTYoBJGTPPWRvXwe8OelsiUkkDnBQ8PLepSZ-XePo5pqBTpWmt_dLaysbM_Enm_CPdAzQCvIwiCrmoKFDbWXsrir5DG0rEbdmg8SrPoBwsrHik1JYbSOdK_vKwPxcu8b-5A%3D%3D&attredirects=0" target = "blank">Nuño (2017)</a>, but the impact on the households' choices, the optimal policies, and the welfare, are not clear yet.

<h3> Education, Income and Intergenerational Persistence: An Evolutionary View </h3>
<h4> with Jijan Fan </h4>

[pdf available upon <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">request</a>]

**Abstract**: Despite that higher education may increase one's lifetime income, we observe intergenerational persistence on education level: children from higher-educated families are more likely to attain higher education than those from lower-educated families. We build a general equilibrium model to explain the natural formation of intergenerational persistence in education, and analyze the evolutionary dynamics. Intuitively, in competitive market, increasing population in
high level education will reduce the return for education; yet, when return of education declines,
given constant education cost, people that will give up education will always be people with
lower education, leading to persistence. We find neutral stability with perfect immobility of education level, but the share of educated population may differ. The implication is (a) intergenerational persistence naturally exists; (b) lump-sum transfer may increase the social efficiency and average education level, but persistence will remain; (c) the only way to achieve efficiency and equality is to give full subsidy on education cost.
