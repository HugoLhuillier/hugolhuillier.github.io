This course is a practical introduction to computer programming designed for Master students in economics. In it, students acquire a comprehensive knowledge of two languages: R and Julia. Additionally, they learn how to interact with their computer via the Unix Shell and how to collaborate on projects thanks to Github.

All the relevant materials will be uploaded on <a href="https://github.com/HugoLhuillier/IntroProg2018" target="blank">Github</a>.

### Outline

The course is made of three sections of unequal lengths:

1. **Introduction** How a computer "thinks"? How to interact with it? How to work collaboratively on programming projects?
2. **Programming: the basics in R** Introduction to data types and structures, logical operators, functions, data analysis, plots, input/output, etc.
3. **Advanced programming in Julia** Introduction to type systems, package management, code profiling and optimization, etc.

### Grading

This course will be graded on a pass / fail basis. The grading will be based on

1. weekly problem sets, ranging from small mathematical challenges Ã  la <a href="https://projecteuler.net/about" target="blank">Project Euler</a>, to package creation and debugging,
2. a four-hour hackathon by teams of 2 / 3.
