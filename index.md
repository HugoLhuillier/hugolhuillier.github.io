<p> I am a research assistant to Nuno Coimbra and Hélène Rey, developing a DSGE with <a href="http://www.helenerey.eu/RP.aspx?pid=Working-Papers_en-GB&aid=194556523_67186463733" target="_blank"> heterogeneous financial intermediaries </a>, and to Nicolas Coeurdacier and Florian Oswald, working on the heterogeneous agent part of their new urban model. You can learn more on these projects, as well as on past works I have contributed to as research assistant, <a href="/research/ra">here</a> <p>

<p> <b>I am applying for PhDs this fall</b>. I completed my Master’s degree in economics in July 2017 at Sciences Po. For my <a href="/research/ind-research.html">Master’s thesis</a>, I worked on an heterogeneous agent model, questioning whether intergenerational transfers are a source of inequality. More generally, my research focuses on heterogeneous agents macroeconomics. I’m particularly interested in introducing strategic thinking in these models, e.g. to study time-consistent and optimal public policies. </p>
