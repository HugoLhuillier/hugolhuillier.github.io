<b> <a href="./files/papers/bilal2020outsourcing.pdf" target="blank"> <span class="char2"> Outsourcing, Inequality and Aggregate Output </span> </a> </b>, with A. Bilal</p>

<h6><u>Abstract</u>: Outsourced workers experience large wage declines, yet domestic outsourcing may raise aggregate productivity. To study this equity-efficiency trade-off, we contribute a framework in which more productive firms either post higher wages along a job ladder to sustain a larger in-house workforce, comprised of many imperfectly substitutable worker types and subject to decreasing returns to scale, or rent labor services from contractors who hire in the same frictional labor markets. Three implications arise: more productive firms are more likely to outsource to save on higher wage premia; outsourcing raises output at the firm level; labor service providers endogenously locate at the bottom of the job ladder, implying that outsourced workers receive lower wages. Using firm-level instruments for outsourcing and revenue productivity, we find empirical support for all three predictions in French administrative data. After structurally estimating the model, we show that the rise in outsourcing in France between 1997 and 2007 increased aggregate output by 1 percent and reduced the labor share by 3 percentage points. </h6>

<b>The Spatial Job Ladder</b></p>

<h6><u>Abstract</u>: Wage inequality varies significantly across cities in the United States. I document that these differences persist after controlling for compositional differences at the city level, and that they are explained by large spatial variation in the right tail of the local wage distributions. I show that within-city wage inequality positively correlates with the local job switching rate. I then propose a spatial theory with monopsonic firms, on-the-job search and sorting that endogenously gives rise to spatially differentiated job ladders. In equilibrium, productive firms locate disproportionately in productive cities, leading to a more intense competition between firms for workers and therefore a steeper wage gradient. </h6>
