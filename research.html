<h6><u>Abstract</u>: Outsourced workers experience large wage declines, yet domestic outsourcing may raise aggregate productivity. To study this equity-efficiency trade-off, we contribute a framework in which firms either hire many imperfectly substitutable worker types in-house by posting wages along a job ladder, or rent labor services from contractors who hire in the same frictional labor markets. Three implications arise. First, more productive firms are more likely to outsource to save on higher wage premia. Second, outsourcing raises output at the firm level. Third, contractors endogenously locate at the bottom of the job ladder, implying that outsourced workers receive lower wages. Using firm-level instruments for outsourcing and revenue productivity, we find empirical support for all three predictions in French administrative data. After structurally estimating the model, we find that the rise in outsourcing in France between 1996 and 2007 raised aggregate output by 3% and reduced the labor share by 0.7 percentage points. A 9% minimum wage increase stabilizes the labor share and maintains two thirds of the output gains. </h6>

<h6><u>Abstract</u>: Supply chain disruptions, which have become commonplace, are often associated with globalization and trade. Little is known about optimal policy in the face of insecure supply chains. Should governments promote resilience by subsidizing backup sources of input supply? Should they encourage firms to source from closer and presumably safer domestic suppliers? We address these questions in a very simple model of production with a single critical input and with exogenous risks of relationship-specific and country-wide supply disturbances. We follow Matsuyama and Ushchev (2020) in positing a class of preferences that are homothetic with a single aggregator and that obey Marshall's Second Law of Demand. The familiar case of CES preferences is a member of the class, but it imposes restrictions that are important for policy conclusions.We find that, in the CES case, a subsidy for diversification achieves the constrained social optimum and dominates a policy that promotes reshoring or offshoring. When the demand elasticity rises with price, two policy instruments generally are needed to achieve efficient supply chains, private investments in resilience may be socially excessive, and policy that alter incentives to invest at home versus abroad may achieve greater welfare than ones that encourage or discourage diversification. </h6>

<b>The Local Root of Wage Inequality</b></p>

<h6><u>Abstract</u>: Cities and jobs go hand-to-hand in explaining wage inequality as the dispersion in worker rents depends on the competition faced by employers, an intrinsically local feature. To study this local root of wage inequality, I document three novel facts. First, high-paying jobs are concentrated in a few cities while low-paying jobs are present everywhere. Second, local search frictions generate city-specific job ladders, and the concentration of high-paying jobs in unequal places render those ladders steeper. Lastly, high-paying jobs are segregated in the locations with larger firm-size wage premia. To rationalize these facts, I contribute a framework of employer sorting in frictional local labor markets. Positive assortative matching prevails: productive jobs are located in larger cities, their higher willingness-to-pay lead to fiercer local competition, and productive employers must offer high wages to attain their desired size. I estimate the model and quantify the fraction of aggregate inequality caused by the spatial sorting of employers. In addition, I compare the effects of place-based policies on the spatial allocation of jobs and inequality to those of a federal policy that improves the reallocation of workers across jobs.  </h6>
