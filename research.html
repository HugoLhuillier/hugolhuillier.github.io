<b>Outsourcing, Inequality and Aggregate Output</b>, with A. Bilal</p>

<h6><u>Abstract</u>: Outsourced workers experience large wage declines, yet domestic outsourcing may raise aggregate productivity and output. We argue that it is useful to conceptualize firmsâ€™ outsourcing decision in the context of frictional labor markets. We contribute a framework in which more productive firms either post higher wages along a job ladder to sustain a larger in-house workforce, comprised of many imperfectly substitutable worker types and subject to decreasing returns to scale, or rent labor services from providers who hire in the same frictional labor markets. Three implications arise: (a) more productive firms are more likely to outsource to save on higher wage premia; (b) outsourcing raises output at the firm level; (c) labor service providers endogenously locate at the bottom of the job ladder, implying that outsourced workers receive lower wages. Using firm-level instruments for outsourcing and revenue productivity, we find empirical support for all three predictions in French administrative data. After structurally estimating the model, we quantify the implications of the rise in outsourcing in France between 1997 and 2007 for aggregate output and the labor share. </h6>
