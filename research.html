<b> <a href="./files/papers/bilal2021outsourcing.pdf" target="blank"> <span class="char2"> Outsourcing, Inequality and Aggregate Output</span></a></b>
<br>with A. Bilal.</p> 

<h6><u>Abstract</u>: Outsourced workers experience large wage declines, yet domestic outsourcing may raise aggregate productivity. To study this equity-efficiency trade-off, we contribute a framework in which firms either hire many imperfectly substitutable worker types in-house by posting wages along a job ladder, or rent labor services from contractors who hire in the same frictional labor markets. Three implications arise. First, more productive firms are more likely to outsource to save on higher wage premia. Second, outsourcing raises output at the firm level. Third, contractors endogenously locate at the bottom of the job ladder, implying that outsourced workers receive lower wages. Using firm-level instruments for outsourcing and revenue productivity, we find empirical support for all three predictions in French administrative data. After structurally estimating the model, we find that the rise in outsourcing in France between 1996 and 2007 raised aggregate output by 3% and reduced the labor share by 0.7 percentage points. A 9% minimum wage increase stabilizes the labor share and maintains two thirds of the output gains. </h6>

<h6><u>Abstract</u>: Supply chain disruptions, which have become commonplace, are often associated with globalization and trade. Little is known about optimal policy in the face of insecure supply chains. Should governments promote resilience by subsidizing backup sources of input supply? Should they encourage firms to source from closer and presumably safer domestic suppliers? We address these questions in a very simple model of production with a single critical input and with exogenous risks of relationship-specific and country-wide supply disturbances. We follow Matsuyama and Ushchev (2020) in positing a class of preferences that are homothetic with a single aggregator and that obey Marshall's Second Law of Demand. The familiar case of CES preferences is a member of the class, but it imposes restrictions that are important for policy conclusions.We find that, in the CES case, a subsidy for diversification achieves the constrained social optimum and dominates a policy that promotes reshoring or offshoring. When the demand elasticity rises with price, two policy instruments generally are needed to achieve efficient supply chains, private investments in resilience may be socially excessive, and policy that alter incentives to invest at home versus abroad may achieve greater welfare than ones that encourage or discourage diversification. </h6>

<b>The Spatial Job Ladder</b></p>

<h6><u>Abstract</u>: Wage inequality varies significantly across cities in the United States. I document that these differences persist after controlling for compositional differences at the city level, and that they are explained by large spatial variation in the right tail of the local wage distributions. I show that within-city wage inequality positively correlates with the local job switching rate. I then propose a spatial theory with monopsonic firms, on-the-job search and sorting that endogenously gives rise to spatially differentiated job ladders. In equilibrium, productive firms locate disproportionately in productive cities, leading to a more intense competition between firms for workers and therefore a steeper wage gradient. </h6>
